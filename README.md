# screwdriver
I was making the [strandbeest](https://github.com/longestcow/strandbeest) project which involved a lot of screwdriving, and my wrist eventually started hurting  
I then realised that an electric screwdriver is literally just a screwdriver with a motor, so went on a side quest to make one for myself  
I carved out the magnetic driver bit holding part from a normal cheap screwdriver, and addtionally used an N20 60RPM motor, 4 AA batteries, and 2 momentary switches such that I could choose the direction of the circuit for clockwise and anti clockwise movement  
I also put on a magnet just as a driver bit storage kinda thing  
[I'll add some images later]
